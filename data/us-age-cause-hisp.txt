Caveats:
"1. Totals and Percent of Total are disabled when data are grouped by a 113 or 130 Cause List because both aggregate and detailed"

"3. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"

"4. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
